# RFF-LLM

Official implementation of **"Exploring the Potential of LLMs for Cross-Domain Radio Frequency Fingerprinting"**.

RFF-LLM is a **dual-modal framework** for cross-domain radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF). It jointly leverages waveform features from a lightweight IQ branch and the domain-agnostic prior of a **frozen LLM** (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B). To bridge the gap between continuous IQ signals and the discrete input space of the LLM, a **VQ-VAE signal tokenizer** converts raw IQ waveforms into discrete tokens, which are then encoded by the frozen LLM under a textual prompt and fused with the IQ branch for transmitter identification.

The framework consistently improves cross-receiver / cross-day generalization on the **WiSig** (ManySig, ManyRx) and **LoRa** datasets.

## Architecture

The pipeline is organized into three sequential stages, the first two of which are fully frozen, leaving the fusion classifier as the only trainable module:

1. **Stage 1 — Signal Tokenizer (VQ-VAE).** A VQ-VAE with EMA codebook updates and dead-code restart is pretrained on source-domain IQ signals to discretize the continuous waveform.
2. **Stage 2 — Prompted LLM Encoding (offline).** The frozen VQ-VAE tokenizes each sample; token IDs are offset into the Qwen vocabulary and embedded, prepended with a textual prompt prefix, and passed through the frozen LLM. The pooled context vector `ctx_vec` is cached to disk.
3. **Stage 3 — Fusion Classifier (trainable).** A patch-based IQ branch (PatchNet) is fused with the projected `ctx_vec` and trained with cross-entropy loss. Only `{IQ branch, projection head, fusion head}` receive gradients.

## Datasets

- **WiSig** — ManySig subset (6 Tx, 12 Rx) and ManyRx subset (10 Tx, 32 Rx). Receivers are split into 4 disjoint groups under a leave-one-group-out protocol; training uses the two earlier capture days, testing uses the two later days of the held-out group (cross-receiver + cross-day, i.e. the `CRD` protocol in `config.py`).
- **LoRa** — `receiver_drift_dataset` subset (10 devices), trained on N210 / tested on RTL-SDR across days. Available at [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/radio-frequency-fingerprint-lora-dataset-multiple-receivers).

## Usage

Run the full three-stage pipeline (each stage auto-skips if its outputs already exist):

```bash
python run_all.py --gpu 0
```

Run a single stage:

```bash
python run_all.py --stage 1 --gpu 0                          # VQ-VAE pretraining
python run_all.py --stage 2 --gpu 0                          # precompute ctx_vec
python run_all.py --stage 3 --gpu 0 --code_state train_test  # fusion training
```

Override key settings from the command line:

```bash
python run_all.py --stage 3 --dataset_name ManyRx --test_round 2 --llm_hidden 16
```

Reproduce the full sweep (2 datasets × 4 folds × 8 projection-bottleneck widths, dual-GPU):

```bash
bash sweep.sh
```

All other hyperparameters (patch size, codebook size `K`, commitment cost `β`, EMA decay, fusion dimension, etc.) are defined in `config.py`.
